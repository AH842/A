# Entity Project 

The Entity project is used to define the **Database Entities** for the **Database project**, these should not be confused with
the _Domain Entities_, when thinking about _Domain Driven Design (DDD)_.  The Entities project is tightly coupled to the 
Database project and the Entities should only most likely only be referenced by the Domain project and associated 
Service layer based projects.
