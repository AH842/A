# Domain Modelling

Domain modeling is also known as conceptual modeling, is an important concept in software engineering. In the domain modeling, we represent the concepts, objects and various other entities that appear in the domain of the problem statement that our software is intended to resolve.

The Domain Project is used to define the Domain Entities, these should not be confused with the Database Entities, the API Template Pack
has made the explicit conscious decision to separate the Domain Entities from the Database Entities, and refer to Database Entities as Models,
which are defined in the Models Project.
