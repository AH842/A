# Getting Started with API Template Pack

Over the past few years there has been an explosion in the usage of API (Application Programmable Interface) which are the interfaces that software apps use to communicate with each other.

A survey published in early 2022 revealed that 90.5% of developers responding were expecting to use APIs more or the same as in 2021, while only 3.8% think they’ll use fewer. The challenge is, as new APIs and protocols emerge, some aren’t supported by existing API management, development and security platforms.

Software Development teams are struggling to make APIs use-able as a result, leading to duplicated efforts, wasted engineering hours, and missed revenue opportunities.

An Effective, Secure and Scalable API are the lifeblood of innovative companies. Whether it’s internally delivering and consuming APIs to more rapidly and efficiently take new products to market, or monetizing consumer-facing APIs as a revenue stream, APIs are now the core building blocks of successful businesses.  More and more more organizations make synchronous and asynchronous API ecosystems a focal point of their business, technical teams now more than ever need to embrace the oncoming API complexity without sacrificing security.

At [threenine](https://threenine.co.uk "Threenine - Software Development Company"), had become frustrated by the lack of innovation in the API tooling space, particularly when it came to be being able to quickly and efficiently starting a new API focused microservices project.

It is important to note that API's will also become a top cyber-security attack vector, therefore it is now more important than ever to develop API's with a security first mindset, and to focus on trusted and reliable patterns and practices based approaches. This is why Threenine will remain committed to ensuring that the API Template Pack is the most feature-packed open source API solution on the market while delivering the robust scalability and features required by the most demanding of enterprise customers.

## What is API Template Pack

The API Template pack provides an opinionated implementation guide to making use of popular leading .net framework based tools and utilities to assist developers to quickly and efficiently develop secure, stable and resilient REST API’s.

The [API Template Pack](https://www.apitemplatepack.com "API Template Pack") has been specifically designed to help teams and organisations to quickly and effectively implement Resource Based Web API's by focusing the the development around a core set of key Software Design patterns, principles, practices and methodologies.

Api Template Pack assists team and developers to implement [REPR (Request-Endpoint-Response) Pattern](docs/introduction/repr-pattern) and [Vertical Slice Architecture](docs/introduction/vertical-slice) when implementing REST Resource based API's.
