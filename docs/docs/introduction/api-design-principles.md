# Principles of Web API Design

There are 5 principles to API design that should be considered in your API Design approach.

### Principle 1
API's should never be designed in isolation

### Principle 2

API design starts with outcome-based focus

### Principle 3
Seek to understand and apply the API elements appropriate to the need

### Principle 4

API documentation is the most important user interface for developers and should be a first class citizen and not left as an after thought.

### Principle 5

API's are forever, so you need to plan accordingly. A thoughtful API design combined with an evolutionary design approach makes API's resilient to change.
